A school project made in the course DT2140 Multimodal Interaction and Interfaces at the Royal Institute of Technology during autumn 2013. A demo of the project could be found in the following link: http://vimeo.com/56764605 . This was a collaboration between Jesper Annebäck, Johan Nygren and Åsa Sproge.


The project is an interactive advent calendar which utilises a couple of different techniques such as: fiducials (reacTIVision), PureData and Processing.

In order for you to run the program you need the TUIO libary for Processing and PureData library.
